<h1>Budget Calculator App - Spring JPA</h1>
<p>This version of the Budget Calculator App implements the Spring JPA framework and uses hibernate to interact with a PostgreSQL database.
  This version also introduces the usage of Lombok, a framework which helps reduce boilerplate code. The BudgetRepository class is now a Spring JPA
  interface. The old SQLData class and LegacyBudgetRepository have been deprecated.</p>
